# NISloadR
An R package to load, clean, and process the National Inpatient Sample (NIS). 

Works with any year of ASCII file. Saves as fst. Bypasses Stata, SAS, and SPSS. Will require the ".Do" Stata script files provided by HCUP as an objective reference. 

Future iterations: to include parallelization for lower memory systems, cleaning tools, plug-and-play ICD identification, and machine learning for forecasting and clustering.
